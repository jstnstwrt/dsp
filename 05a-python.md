# Learn Python

Read Allen Downey's [Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/) for getting up to speed with Python 2.7 and computer science topics. It's completely available online, or you can buy a physical copy if you would like.

For quick and easy interactive practice with Python, many people enjoy [Codecademy's Python track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python). There's also [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/).

###Q3. Lambda Function

Describe Python's `lambda`. What is it, and what is it used for? Give at least one example, including an example of using a `lambda` in the `key` argument to `sorted`.

>> A lambda function is an anonymous function that can be defined at runtime. They constrained to be only one single expression and can reference functions for the containing scope. 

>> It is very helpful, and often more concise, when a small function is needed on the fly. Also, it is useful when you want to define a function as the output of another function or use a function as the input of another function. 

>> I used a lambda function in my solution to the front_back fucntion in q6_strings.py:

>>```
def front_back(a, b):
	g = lambda s: (len(s) + 1)/2
    return a[:g(a)] + b[:g(b)] + a[g(a):] + b[g(b):]
```
