[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>>The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

>> This exercise is aimed at understanding the pseudo-random number generating process underlying the implementation of random.random. Specifically, we preform a simple test to see if the numbers are generated by from a uniform distribution. We generate 1000 numbers and inspect the corresponding probability mass function and cummulative distribution fucnction, shown in the figure below. The key observation is that the pmf is relatively flat, i.e., the observations are approximately equally distributed across all of the bins. This feature is what determines the relatively straight diagonal line of the cdf. These observations confrom to the theory that the sample was drawn from a uniform distribution.
