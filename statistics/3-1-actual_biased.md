[Think Stats Chapter 3 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2004.html#toc31) (actual vs. biased)

>> We investigated how bais can be introduced into a sampled distibution of family sizes (i.e., the number of children) if an investigator gathers response data from the children instead of the parent. This observation is immediately apparent when we consider that familiies with no children would be excluded from the sample altogether if the data is gathered in this fashion. We demonstrate this bias more precisely by constructing both the actual and biased probability mass functions. A probability mass function is simply a distribution of frequencies normalized by the total number of observations. 
>>First, we created the actual distribution by normalizing the histogram of family size data by the number of families sampled. Then we created the biased distibution by rewieghting the actual distibution to yeild the values we would have found if we solicited responses from each child from each family. That is, by multiplying the weight associated with a family size by the number of times we would have received that response from the *same* family (i.e., the number of children). The corresponding distributions are shown in Figure 1 below. The difference between the distibutions is made precise by considering the differnce in means: actual mean is 1.024 and the biased mean is 2.404.
