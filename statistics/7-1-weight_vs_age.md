[Think Stats Chapter 7 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2008.html#toc70) (weight vs. age)

>> In this exercise we explore the relationship between a mother's pregnancy age and the weight of their baby in the NSFG dataset. In the figure below there are two plots depicting this relationship: (above) a scatter plot of the raw data and (below) a plot of the 25,50,75th percentiles of mother's pregnancy age against the baby weight variable. We also compute the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficents, 0.069 and 0.094 respectively.
