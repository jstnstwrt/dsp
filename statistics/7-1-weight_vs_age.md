[Think Stats Chapter 7 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2008.html#toc70) (weight vs. age)

>> In this exercise we explore the relationship between a mother's pregnancy age and the weight of their baby in the NSFG dataset. In the figure below there are two plots depicting this relationship: (above) a scatter plot of the raw data and (below) a plot of the 25,50,75th percentiles of baby's birth weight against the mother's pregnancy age. We also compute the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficents, 0.069 and 0.094 respectively. The plots seem to demonstrate that there is almost no relationship between a mother's age and the birth weight of their baby. This is seen by considering that a change in the mother's age (x axis) does not correspond to any consistent variation in the birthweight of the baby (y axis), i.e., the line looks approximately flat. This is confirmed by extremely low correlation coefficients given above.
